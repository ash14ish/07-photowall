## Implementation

- Pure class based components.
- this.setState() is used for state management.
- React Redux is used for complex state management.
- React Router is used to make the React SPA (single page applications).
- Various life cycle methods such as ComponentDidUpdate, ComponentDidMount is used to achieve state and props update and rendering.
- React event management and lifting state up.
- Firebase is used to collect and store the data.
- ActionCreators are used to consume the promises before dispatching an action. Redux and redux-thunk (applyMiddleware) is used to achieve this.
